# Introduction

`use-cardano` is a react context, hook, and set of components that makes interacting with the Cardano blockchain super easy. It allows you to connect web3 dApp wallets using the [CIP-30 Web Bridge](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip30/) and [lucid](https://github.com/spacebudz/lucid) for tasks such as signing transactions and interacting with smart contracts.

## At-a-glance

While highly customizable, getting started with `use-cardano` is easy. Here's a minimal example of how to use it:

```tsx copy
import { useCardano, useCardanoContext, SelectWalletProvider } from "use-cardano"

const App = () => {
  useCardano(config)

  const { account } = useCardanoContext()

  return (
    <div>
      <SelectWalletProvider />

      <div>Connected Address: {account.address}</div>
    </div>
  )
}
```
