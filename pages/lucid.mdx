# Lucid

Lucid is the engine that powers use-cardano for everything related to the Cardano blockchain. I highly recommend that you familiarize yourself with it, by visiting their [github repository](https://www.github.com/spazebudz/lucid).

If you are just looking to integrate use-cardano into your project, you can [skip](/concepts) this section for now.
