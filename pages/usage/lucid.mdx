# Lucid

Lucid is the engine that powers use-cardano for everything related to the Cardano blockchain. We highly recommend that you familiarize yourself with it, by visiting their [github repository](https://www.github.com/spazebudz/lucid).

If you are just looking to get on with integrate use-cardano into your project, you can [skip](/concepts) this section for now, but chances are you will need to come back to it later.

## What is Lucid?

According to Lucid themselves, Lucid is

> "a library, which allows you to create Cardano transactions and off-chain code for your Plutus contracts in JavaScript, Deno and Node.js."

## How does it work?

Coming soon ...

## How do I access Lucid in use-cardano?

when using the useCardano hook, an instance of Lucid is available as the lucid property. This will be either an instance of Lucid, or if - for example - the user has not connected their wallet, undefined.

```ts filename="useCardano.ts" {3} copy
import { useCardano } from "use-cardano"

const { lucid } = useCardano()
```

## What is Lucid used for in use-cardano?

In use-cardano, Lucid is used for everything related to the Cardano blockchain. It is used to create and sign transactions, and interact with smart contracts. There are a bunch of examples of this, which you can find in the [examples](/examples) section.

```ts filename="simple-mint.ts" copy
const tx = await lucid
  .newTx()
  .mintAssets({ [unit]: 1n })
  .validTo(Date.now() + 100000)
  .attachMintingPolicy(mintingPolicy)
  .complete()
```
