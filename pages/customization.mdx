# Customization

While you can use use-cardano as-is, it is fully customizable. This page will go over the different ways you can customize the library.

## Custom styles

use-cardano allows you to easily overwrite the default styles of its components. This is simply done with vanilla CSS, with a small set of classes, using BEM naming conventions. This allows for a straightforward implementation of your own styles, without having to worry about the internal structure of the components and fighting selector rule specificity.

## BEM naming conventions

These are the classes used by use-cardano, more information and context coming. I am planning on doing a more visual breakdown so you easily can see what element each class is applied to.

- .cardano-wallet-selector
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_button
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_button--active
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_button--loading
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_button--warning
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_button\_\_icon
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_button\_\_text
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_button\_\_warning-sign
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_menu
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_menu\_\_item
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_menu\_\_item button
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_menu\_\_item button:disabled
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_menu\_\_item button:not(:disabled):hover
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_menu\_\_item--current button
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_menu\_\_item--current\_\_checkmark
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_menu\_\_item\_\_text
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_menu\_\_item\_\_text\_\_icon
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_menu\_\_item:last-child
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_menu\_\_item:last-child button
- .cardano-toaster
- .cardano-toaster--open
- .cardano-toaster\_\_content
- .cardano-toaster\_\_close-button
- .cardano-toaster\_\_warning-list
- .cardano-notification
- .cardano-notification--open
- .cardano-notification\_\_content

If you don't whish to use the default styles at all, you can do so by simply not importing the `use-cardano/styles/use-cardano.css` file in your application. This will remove the default styles, but leave the class names according to the BEM naming convention for you to style to your liking.

## Custom themes

This is not implemented yet, but in an upcoming release, we will provide a few preset themes that you can use. You can track progress of this in [this issue](https://github.com/GGAlanSmithee/use-cardano/issues/32)
