## Styling

use-cardano comes with a set of fully styled components, which we try to keep as un-opinionated as possible to allow for wide usage out-of-the-box.

With that said, use-cardano allows you to easily overwrite the default styles of its components. This is done simply with a small set of classes in vanilla CSS, using BEM naming conventions. This allows for a straightforward implementation of your own styles, without having to worry about the internal structure of the components or fighting selector rule specificity.

## BEM naming conventions

These are the classes used by use-cardano, more information and context coming. We are planning on doing a more visual breakdown so you easily can see what element each class is applied to.

- .cardano-wallet-selector
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_button
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_button--active
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_button--loading
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_button--warning
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_button\_\_content
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_button\_\_loading-spinner
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_button\_\_loading-spinner:after
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_menu
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_menu\_\_item
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_menu\_\_item button
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_menu\_\_item button:disabled
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_menu\_\_item button:not(:disabled):hover
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_menu\_\_item--current button
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_menu\_\_item--current\_\_checkmark
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_menu\_\_item\_\_text
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_menu\_\_item\_\_text\_\_icon
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_menu\_\_item:last-child
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_menu\_\_item:last-child button
- .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_menu\_\_item .cardano-wallet-selector\_\_menu\_\_item\_\_disconnect
- .cardano-toaster
- .cardano-toaster--open
- .cardano-toaster--top
- .cardano-toaster--bottom
- .cardano-toaster--right
- .cardano-toaster--left
- .cardano-toaster\_\_content
- .cardano-toaster\_\_close-button
- .cardano-toaster\_\_warning-list

If you don't whish to use the default styles at all, you can do so by simply not importing the `use-cardano/styles/use-cardano.css` file in your application. This will remove the default styles, but leave the class names according to the BEM naming convention for you to style to your liking.
