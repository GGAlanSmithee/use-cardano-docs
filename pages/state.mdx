# State

The `useCardano` hook returns a `UseCardanoState` object. This is subject to a large refactor in the near future, so we will wait with documenting it until then, but for now you can look at the [use-cardano types](https://github.com/use-cardano/use-cardano/blob/main/src/types/use-cardano.d.ts#L57) for the full type definition.
