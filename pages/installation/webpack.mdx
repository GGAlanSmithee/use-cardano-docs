# Webpack Configuration

You'll need to configure webpack to support top-level await and WebAssembly. Assuming you are using webpack 5, you can do this by adding the following configuration.

```js filename="webpack.config.js" copy
module.exports = {
  experiments: {
    topLevelAwait: true,
    asyncWebAssembly: true,
    layers: true, // optional, required with some bundlers/frameworks
  },
}
```
